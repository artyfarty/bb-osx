For Unix
   You need following libraries: aalib
   In most cases you should use:

   CFLAGS=your best optimizing switches
   export CFLAGS
    #note that first two lines are usually not needed in case you use
    #gnu c compiler where AA-lib uses quite good ones automatically
   ./configure
    #make sure that makefile contains your favorite switches
   make
   Follow instructions displayed by make to enable sound

   see help for configure in case of problems

For DOS:
